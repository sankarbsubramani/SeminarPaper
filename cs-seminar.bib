%
%    * Article: An article from a journal or magazine.
% 
%    * Book:  A book with an explicit publisher.

%
%    * Inbook: A part of a book, which may be a chapter and/or a 
%              range of pages.
%
%    * Incollection: A part of a book having its own title.
%
%    * Inproceedings: An article in a conference proceedings.
%
%    * Manual: Technical documentation.
%
%    * Mastersthesis: A Master's thesis.
%
%    * Misc: This is used when other entries do not fit.
%
%    * Phdthesis: A PhD thesis.
%
%    * Proceedings: The proceedings of a conference.
%
%    * Techreport: A report published by a school or other institution, 
%                  usually numbered within a series.
%
%    * Unpublished: A document having an author and title, but not
